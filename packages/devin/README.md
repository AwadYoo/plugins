# @magpie-community/opencode-devin-auth

Signs in to a [Devin](https://devin.ai) subscription, the account the
`devin` CLI uses, and makes its requests, in OpenCode and in magpie.
Provider id: `devin`.

## Signing in

An account is the CLI's session token (`devin-session-token$…`). There are
two ways to get one:

- **Devin (browser)**: the CLI's own `devin auth login`, run by the
  plugin. It is a PKCE sign-in through `app.devin.ai/auth/cli/continue`
  back to a callback on `127.0.0.1`. The code is exchanged for the token
  at `server.codeium.com` (`ExchangeDevinCLIPKCECode`).
- **Devin CLI's sign-in**: takes the account the CLI is signed in to, from
  its `credentials.toml` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/devin/`, by default
  `~/.local/share/devin/`; `%APPDATA%\devin\` on Windows). The file is only
  read, never changed.

The plugin names the account as Devin does when asked with the token
(`GetUserStatus`: its email and tier). When Devin can't tell, and the CLI
is installed, it asks `devin auth status`, run with a data folder of the
plugin's own, `~/.cache/opencode-devin-auth/<hash of the token>/`, so the
CLI's own sign-in is never touched. A CLI that reads another
`credentials.toml` than that folder's (on Windows it reads
`%APPDATA%\devin\` whatever it is run with) isn't asked: it would name
its own account. Otherwise the account is named "Devin".

The token is kept where OpenCode keeps sign-ins (`auth.json`; in magpie,
`plugin-auth.json`) as `{ "type": "api", "key", "metadata": { "email", "plan" } }`.
Devin doesn't expire it on a schedule, so there is nothing to refresh;
when it is refused, requests fail with a 401 saying to sign in again.

## Requests

Devin serves chat through Windsurf's API server, as the CLI does:
`POST https://server.codeium.com/exa.api_server_pb.ApiServerService/GetChatMessage`,
a Connect RPC in protobuf, with `Authorization: Basic <token>`.
`WINDSURF_API_SERVER_URL` moves the server, as it does for the CLI.

The plugin's `fetch` handles this:

- It turns OpenCode's chat completion into the CLI's request (devin-cli
  3000.11.3).
  - The system prompt goes at the head of the first user message.
  - Each tool's description goes there too, in a `<tool_descriptions>`
    block, and the tool is sent with a pointer to it. Devin answers "an
    internal error occurred" to some agents' tool descriptions when they
    are sent as the tools' own.
  - A tool call the conversation never answered is answered with "Tool use
    was interrupted and did not produce a result."
  - Images must be inline (`data:` URLs); images in tool results are
    dropped.
- It turns the streamed reply back into a chat completion, streamed or
  not: text, reasoning, tool calls and usage.
- Failures keep their statuses: a refused token is a 401, a usage limit a
  429, a prompt too long for the model a 400.

## Models

Devin's models are families: `swe-2`, `claude-opus-5-5`, `gpt-6-sol`, …
Each family has variants at each effort (`swe-2-high`,
`claude-opus-5-5-xhigh`), and some have a fast or priority run
(`claude-opus-5-5-high-fast`). The plugin lists each family once, with
the efforts its variants are at, plus its fast or priority run
(`claude-opus-5-5-fast`). The variant asked for is the one at the effort
picked, or the nearest the family has; with none picked, the family's
default. Variants at no effort (`glm-5-2-1m`) are listed as they are.
Adaptive and Fusion aren't listed; they route between models inside
Devin's own agent.

The `config` hook declares Devin's list as of 2026-09-30 (87 models).
Once signed in, and with the CLI installed, the `provider.models` hook
replaces it with the account's own, from `devin models list`, when the CLI
answers for the account: it reads the plugin's data folder for it, and
names the account Devin names the token's. When it doesn't (on Windows),
the account keeps the declared list. The list is
cached for 5 minutes; after a failed read, the plugin tries again after 1
minute.

## Not included

magpie's built-in Devin account does more than this plugin:

- **Usage**: the plan's quota windows.
- **Several accounts** at once.
- **Web search**: its stand-in for Anthropic's server-side web search tool.
