# @magpie-commuity/opencode-factory-auth

Signs in to a [Factory](https://factory.ai) (Droid) subscription and sends
model requests to Factory's API the way `droid` sends them. Provider id:
`factory`.

## Sign-in

- **Sign in with Factory (device code).** This is WorkOS's device flow
  under droid's own client. The browser opens Factory's page with the code
  filled in. Confirm it there, and the plugin picks up the tokens.
- **Organization.** A token that isn't in an organization yet is put in
  the first one your account belongs to.
- **Whoami.** The plugin asks `whoami` for your active organization, its
  region (EU orgs go to `api.eu.factory.ai`) and any host of the org's
  own. Every request then carries them, as droid's do.

## Where the sign-in is kept

The sign-in is kept wherever the host keeps provider sign-ins:

- OpenCode: `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`
- magpie: `plugin-auth.json`

It holds WorkOS's access and refresh tokens, with the organization,
region and host.

**Refreshing.** The access token is renewed two minutes before it lapses.
WorkOS rotates the refresh token, so the plugin never runs two refreshes
at once.

**Refusals.** If Factory refuses the organization a request names, the
plugin asks `whoami` again and resends the request once. If the refusal
stands, the error says what to check.

## Models

Each model is served on the one API droid uses for it:

| API | Models |
|---|---|
| Anthropic Messages (`/api/llm/a`) | Fable 5.1, Fable 5, Opus 5.5, Opus 5, Opus 4.8, Sonnet 5.5, Sonnet 5, Sonnet 4.6, Haiku 4.5, MiniMax M2.7 |
| OpenAI Responses (`/api/llm/o/v1`) | GPT-6 Sol/Astra/Luna, GPT-5.6 Sol/Terra/Luna, GPT-5.5, GPT-5.4, GPT-5.3-Codex, Grok 4.7, Grok 4.6 |
| Chat completions (`/api/llm/o/v1`) | GLM-5.3, GLM-5.3-Flash, GLM-5.2, Kimi K3, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash, Qwen3.8 Max, MiniMax M3, Mistral Medium 3.5, Nemotron 3 Ultra |

Reasoning efforts are the variants droid offers for each model.

The list is not included:

- Gemini, which Factory sends on a route of its own.
- auto, which droid picks on the client side.
